Keepalived is a routing software written in C. The main goal of this project is to provide simple and robust facilities for loadbalancing and high-availability to Linux system and Linux based infrastructures. 

1. virtual ip migration
slave:
# apt-get install keepalived
# vim /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf
vrrp_instance VI_1 {
    state BACKUP
    #interface: which interface sends the multicast message
    interface eth2 # gretap1 / eth0
    virtual_router_id 51
    priority 90
    advert_int 1
    authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass 1111
    }
    virtual_ipaddress {
        10.9.13.23 dev eth0 # the virtual ip sets on eth0
    }
}
# service keepalive start

master:
# vim /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf
vrrp_instance VI_1 {
    state MASTER
    interface eth2 # gretap1/ eth0
    virtual_router_id 51
    priority 100 # bigger than slave one
    advert_int 1
    authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass 1111
    }
    virtual_ipaddress {
        10.9.13.23 dev eth0
    }
}
# service keepalive start
