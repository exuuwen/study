1. Scope:

enum rt_scope_t {
	RT_SCOPE_UNIVERSE=0, /*global type */
/* User defined values  */
	RT_SCOPE_SITE=200,
	RT_SCOPE_LINK=253, /*link type*/
	RT_SCOPE_HOST=254,  /local type*/
	RT_SCOPE_NOWHERE=255
};


2. IP ADDR:

RT_SCOPE_UNIVERSE: the addr is used for global(local, link, outside)
ip addr add 1.2.3.4/24 dev eth0

RT_SCOPE_LINK: the addr is used for link(local, link)
ip addr add 10.1.2.3/24 dev eth0 scope link

RT_SCOPE_HOST: the addr is used only for local
ip addr add 20.1.2.3/24 dev eth0 scope host


In default the 3 kinds of scope no difference in kernel

when arp_ignore = 2 the IP(10.1.2.3) only can reply the arp request from the link level (the same subnet) for it
when arp_ignore = 3 the host scope IP(20.1.2.3) does't replay the arp request for it


when arp_announce = 1, 如果发送报文的src与target是同意网段的就优先使用
when arp_announce = 2, arp不会选择发送dev上的scope为host和二级地址作为源地址发送，如果没有就选择其他dev上的global主地址



3. IP ROUTE:

RT_SCOPE_HOST: in the local table, the route is only used for receive the packet to the local
local 1.2.3.4 dev eth0  proto kernel  scope host  src 1.2.3.4
local 10.1.2.3 dev eth0  proto kernel  scope host  src 1.2.3.4
local 20.1.2.3 dev eth0  proto kernel  scope host  src 1.2.3.4

RT_SCOPE_LINK: the packet send out to link peer through this route. It needs the L2 protocol 
ip route add 1.2.3.0/24 dev eth0


RT_SCOPE_UNIVERSE: the packet sent out to out side the Lan via a gatway
ip addr add default via 1.2.3.10 dev eth0
rule: the scope for the route to the gate way is near than the universe. the scope of the route to gateway 1.2.3.10 is link, so it is near than the global
