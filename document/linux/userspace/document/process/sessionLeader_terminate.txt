problem:
As we know a bash window is a session and the bash shell is the session leader process. What happend when the shell terminated.
The session leader ignore the SIGINT, SIGQUIT and SIGTERM signal.

1. SIGKILL
The session leader will terminate all he frontgroud processes and terminate itself. But the backgroud processes will survive and become the orphan processes.

2. SIGHUP
A seesion is launched by ssh connection. When the network shutdown the session leader will recieve a SIGHUP
The session leader will sends SIGHUP to all the processes in this this and then terminated itself.

So how process can prevent terminating by signal SIGHUP in this situation
a. capture or ignore the SIGHUP signal
b. make your process to a deamon program
