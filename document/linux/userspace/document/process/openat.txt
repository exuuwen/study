1. openat
The openat() system call operates in exactly the same way as open(2), except for the differences described in this manual page.

If  the  pathname given in pathname is relative, then it is interpreted relative to the directory referred to by the file descriptor
dirfd (rather than relative to the current working directory of the calling process, as is done by open(2) for a relative pathname).

If pathname is relative and dirfd is the special value AT_FDCWD, then pathname is interpreted relative to the current working direc©\
tory of the calling process

$ cat openat.c
int main()
{
    int dfd, ffd;
    dfd = open("/home/test/tmp", O_RDONLY);
    if(dfd < 1)
    {
        perror("open home");
        return -1;
    }
    ffd = openat(dfd, "test1.txt", O_CREAT | O_RDWR, 0775);
    if(ffd < 1)
    {
        perror("open new file");
        return -1;
    }

    close(dfd);
    close(ffd);

    return 0;
}

$ pwd
/home/test
$ gcc -o openat openat.c
$ ./openat
$ ls /home/test/tmp/test1.txt
/home/test/tmp/test1.txt
