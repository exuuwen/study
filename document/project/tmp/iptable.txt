nat:
                  This table is consulted when a packet that creates a new connection is encountered.  It consists of three built-ins: PRE‐
                  ROUTING  (for  altering packets as soon as they come in), OUTPUT (for altering locally-generated packets before routing),
                  and POSTROUTING (for altering packets as they are about to go out).

SQUERADE
       This target is only valid in the nat table, in the POSTROUTING chain.  It should only be used with dynamically assigned IP  (dialup)
       connections: if you have a static IP address, you should use the SNAT target.

iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -s 10.0.20.7 -j MASQUERADE


SNAT
       This  target is only valid in the nat table, in the POSTROUTING chain.  It specifies that the source address of the packet should be
       modified 

iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p icmp -o eth0 -s 10.0.20.7 -j SNAT --to-source 192.168.130.128
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p tcp --dport 22 -o eth0 -s 10.0.20.7 -j SNAT --to-source 192.168.130.128

iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p udp --dport 2152 -o eth0 -s 10.0.20.7 -j SNAT --to-source 192.168.130.128:1234



DNAT
       This  target is only valid in the nat table, in the PREROUTING and OUTPUT chains, and user-defined chains which are only called from
       those chains.  It specifies that the destination address of the packet should be modified

iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp --dport 2152 -i eth0 -s 192.168.130.143 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.0.20.7:1234
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 22 -i eth0 -s 192.168.130.143 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.0.20.7



mangle:
                  This table is used for specialized packet alteration.  Until kernel 2.4.17 it had two built-in  chains:  PREROUTING  (for
                  altering incoming packets before routing) and OUTPUT (for altering locally-generated packets before routing).  Since ker‐
                  nel 2.4.18, three other built-in chains are also supported: INPUT (for packets coming into the box itself), FORWARD  (for
                  altering packets being routed through the box), and POSTROUTING (for altering packets as they are about to go out).

MARK:
iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 22 -j MARK --set-mark 2

TOS:
iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p TCP --dport 22 -j TOS --set-tos 0x10

TTL:
iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -j TTL --ttl-set 64
