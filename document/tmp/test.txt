 When  bash  is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive shell with the --login option, it first reads and exe\
       cutes commands from the file  /etc/profile,  if  that  file  exists.   After  reading  that  file,  it  looks  for  ~/.bash_profile,
       ~/.bash_login,  and  ~/.profile, in that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable.  The
       --noprofile option may be used when the shell is started to inhibit this behavior.

       When a login shell exits, bash reads and executes commands from the file ~/.bash_logout, if it exists.

       When an interactive shell that is not a login shell  is  started,  bash  reads  and  executes  commands  from  /etc/bash.bashrc  and
       ~/.bashrc,  if  these  files  exist.  This may be inhibited by using the --norc option.  The --rcfile file option will force bash to
       read and execute commands from file instead of /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc.
